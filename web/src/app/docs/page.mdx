# Clawkeeper Documentation

Clawkeeper is an open-source security scanner and hardening tool for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) AI agent deployments. It runs 39 automated checks across host hardening, network security, prerequisites, and runtime configuration — then gives you a letter grade (A–F) and auto-fixes what it can.

## Quick start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawkeeper.dev/install.sh | bash
```

That's it. No account, no dependencies, no configuration. The installer drops a single bash script and launches an interactive menu.

## What it does

1. **Scans** your machine for security misconfigurations (firewall, disk encryption, SSH hardening, exposed credentials, malicious skills, CVEs)
2. **Grades** your setup from A to F based on what passes
3. **Fixes** common issues automatically when you run in interactive mode
4. **Reports** results to an optional SaaS dashboard for fleet monitoring

## Documentation sections

- [Installation](/docs/installation) — curl install, macOS desktop app, Helm chart, environment variables
- [CLI Reference](/docs/cli) — commands, flags, interactive menu, agent subcommands
- [Configuration](/docs/configuration) — API keys, agent setup, environment variables
- [Grading](/docs/grading) — scoring formula, grade thresholds, how SKIPPED and FIXED checks are handled
- [Security Checks](/docs/checks) — full reference of all 39 checks, grouped by phase

## Open source

Clawkeeper is open source. The check definitions live in `checks/*/check.toml` and the CLI logic lives in `lib/orchestrator.sh`. These docs are auto-generated from those source files — when a check changes, the docs update on the next build.
