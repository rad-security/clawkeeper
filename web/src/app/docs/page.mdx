# Clawkeeper Documentation

Clawkeeper is an open-source security scanner and hardening tool for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) AI agent deployments. It runs 44 automated checks across host hardening, network security, prerequisites, and runtime configuration — then gives you a letter grade (A–F) and auto-fixes what it can.

## Quick start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawkeeper.dev/install.sh | bash
```

That's it. No account, no dependencies, no configuration. The installer drops a single bash script and launches an interactive menu.

## What it does

1. **Scans** your machine for security misconfigurations (firewall, disk encryption, SSH hardening, exposed credentials, malicious skills, CVEs)
2. **Grades** your setup from A to F based on what passes
3. **Fixes** common issues automatically when you run in interactive mode
4. **Reports** results to an optional SaaS dashboard for fleet monitoring
5. **Detects CVEs** by checking your OpenClaw version against a live vulnerability feed
6. **Generates insights** — AI-powered security analysis that identifies regressions, credential exposure, fleet drift, and quick wins (Pro)
7. **Sends alerts** — email and webhook notifications when critical issues are detected (Pro)

## Plans

The CLI scanner is free and always will be. The web dashboard has three tiers:

- **Free** — full 44-check CLI scanner, auto-fix, 10 scans/month, 1 host, 7-day scan history
- **Pro** (from $16/mo) — 200 scans/month with rollover, 15 hosts, 365-day history, CVE audit, AI insights, alerts
- **Enterprise** — unlimited everything, Kubernetes hardening, eBPF runtime detection, SSO/SAML

See [Plans & Pricing](/docs/plans) for the full comparison.

## Open source

Clawkeeper is open source. The check definitions live in `checks/*/check.toml` and the CLI logic lives in `lib/orchestrator.sh`. These docs are auto-generated from those source files — when a check changes, the docs update on the next build.
