# Installation

Clawkeeper supports three installation methods: CLI (macOS/Linux), the macOS desktop app, and Kubernetes via Helm.

## CLI (recommended)

One command installs the scanner. Pure bash — no runtime dependencies.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawkeeper.dev/install.sh | bash
```

This downloads `clawkeeper.sh` to your machine and makes it executable. Run `clawkeeper.sh` to launch the interactive menu, or pass a command directly:

```bash
clawkeeper.sh scan        # Read-only security audit
clawkeeper.sh setup       # Interactive hardening wizard
clawkeeper.sh deploy      # Full install + deployment
```

### Supported platforms

- **macOS** — 11 host hardening checks, 4 network checks, full prereq + audit suite
- **Linux** — Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, Arch. 7 host hardening checks, 2 network checks, full prereq + audit suite
- **Windows** — install WSL2, then run Clawkeeper from within WSL

## macOS Desktop App

A native macOS app with a visual interface for scanning and deployment.

[Download Clawkeeper.dmg](https://github.com/clawkeeper/clawkeeper/releases/latest/download/Clawkeeper.dmg)

The desktop app runs the same checks as the CLI but presents results in a graphical interface with guided deployment steps.

## Kubernetes (Enterprise)

Deploy OpenClaw into Kubernetes with hardened defaults and RAD Security runtime protection.

```bash
helm repo add clawkeeper https://charts.clawkeeper.dev
helm install openclaw clawkeeper/openclaw-stack \
    --set rad.enabled=true
```

See the [enterprise section](/#enterprise) on the landing page for details on what's included in the Helm chart.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `CLAWKEEPER_API_KEY` | API key for SaaS dashboard reporting. Optional — the CLI works without it. |

Set your API key before running the agent:

```bash
export CLAWKEEPER_API_KEY="ck_live_..."
clawkeeper.sh agent --install
```

See [Configuration](/docs/configuration) for more details.
