## FAQ

### Does the CLI scanner require a paid plan?

No. The CLI scanner is free and unlimited. You can run all 43 checks, use auto-fix, and generate local reports without an account.

### What happens when I hit the host limit?

The agent will still run scans locally, but new hosts won't appear on the dashboard. Upgrade your plan to add more hosts.

### Can I try Pro before buying?

The free tier gives you access to the full scanner. Upgrade when you need more hosts, extended history, or the intelligence features (CVEs, insights, alerts).

### How do I upgrade?

Go to [Settings](/settings) in the dashboard and click **Upgrade to Pro**. Payment is handled securely through Stripe.

### Can I cancel anytime?

Yes. Manage your subscription through the billing portal in [Settings](/settings). Your account reverts to the free tier at the end of the billing period.
