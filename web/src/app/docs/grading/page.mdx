# Grading

Clawkeeper assigns a letter grade (A–F) based on the percentage of scored checks that pass. The grading system is designed to be fair — skipped checks don't penalize you, and auto-fixed checks count as passes.

## Scoring formula

```
score = (PASS + FIXED) / (PASS + FIXED + FAIL) * 100
```

- **PASS** — check passed without intervention
- **FIXED** — check initially failed but was auto-remediated during the scan
- **FAIL** — check failed and was not fixed
- **SKIPPED** — check was not applicable (e.g., a macOS check on Linux) or the user declined to fix it

Skipped checks are excluded from the denominator entirely. They represent accepted risk, not a security failure.

## Grade thresholds

| Grade | Score | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | 95–100% | Excellent — nearly everything passing |
| **B** | 85–94% | Good — a few issues to address |
| **C** | 70–84% | Fair — multiple security gaps |
| **D** | 50–69% | Poor — significant hardening needed |
| **F** | 0–49% | Critical — most checks failing |

## Examples

### Clean macOS install with Docker

A fresh macOS machine running Docker mode might score:

- 8 host checks pass, 3 fail (no FileVault, firewall off, auto-login enabled)
- 4 network checks pass
- 1 prereq passes (Docker)
- 6 audit checks pass, 2 fail

Score: `(8+4+1+6) / (8+4+1+6+3+2) * 100` = **79%** = **C**

### After running `setup`

If you re-run with `setup` and accept all remediations:

- 3 previously failed checks get auto-fixed
- 2 checks remain failed (manual fix required)

Score: `(8+4+1+6+3) / (8+4+1+6+3+2) * 100` = **92%** = **B**

## How FIXED works

When a check fails in interactive mode, Clawkeeper may offer an auto-remediation:

```
✗ macOS Firewall is disabled

  → Enable the firewall now? [y/N]
```

If you accept and the fix succeeds, the check is marked **FIXED** instead of FAIL. Fixed checks count the same as passes in the score.

## CVE impact on grading

The CVE vulnerability audit check runs in Phase 4 (Security Audit). Each CVE found against your installed OpenClaw version counts as an individual FAIL. This means a host with multiple known CVEs will see a significant score impact — upgrade your OpenClaw version to resolve them.

## Dashboard tracking

If you have an API key configured, each scan's grade and score are sent to the [dashboard](/dashboard). The dashboard provides:

- **Grade history** — track your grade over time to spot regressions and config drift
- **Score trends** — visualize score changes across scans (Pro)
- **AI-powered insights** — automatic analysis of scan results to surface critical findings, regressions, credential exposure, CVE vulnerabilities, and quick wins (Pro)
- **Email & webhook alerts** — get notified when critical issues are detected (Pro)

See [Configuration](/docs/configuration) for how to set up the agent, and [Dashboard Features](/docs/dashboard) for details on Pro features.
