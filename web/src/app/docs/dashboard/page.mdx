# Dashboard Features

The Clawkeeper web dashboard at [clawkeeper.dev/dashboard](/dashboard) provides fleet monitoring, security intelligence, and alerting for your OpenClaw deployments. The dashboard is optional — the CLI scanner works without it.

## Overview

When you connect the Clawkeeper agent to the dashboard, each scan uploads results automatically. The dashboard then provides:

- **Fleet overview** — see all hosts, their grades, scores, and last scan times at a glance
- **Host detail pages** — drill into individual hosts to see scan history and check results
- **Activity stream** — chronological feed of scans, grade changes, check flips, and host registrations
- **AI-powered insights** — automated security analysis that surfaces critical findings (Pro)
- **CVE intelligence** — live vulnerability feed cross-referenced against your installations (Pro)
- **Email & webhook alerts** — get notified when issues are detected (Pro)

## Free tier

Every dashboard account includes:

- Full 43-check CLI scanner with auto-fix
- Up to 3 hosts on the dashboard
- 7-day scan history
- 1 API key
- Letter grade and score tracking

## Pro features

### CVE vulnerability audit

The dashboard cross-references your scan results with the live [OpenClaw CVE feed](https://github.com/jgamblin/OpenClawCVEs). When a scan detects CVEs affecting your installed version, the dashboard creates insights with:

- CVE ID and link to the NVD entry
- Severity level and CVSS score
- Affected packages and version ranges
- Specific upgrade guidance

### AI-powered insights

The insight engine analyzes every scan and generates actionable findings:

| Insight Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **Critical failure** | High-severity checks that failed (privileged mode, credential exposure, container escape) |
| **Credential exposure** | Secrets found in configs, shell history, MEMORY.md, or session logs |
| **CVE vulnerability** | Known CVEs matching your installed OpenClaw version |
| **New regression** | Checks that previously passed but now fail |
| **Grade degradation** | Host grade dropped since last scan |
| **Fleet inconsistency** | Same check passes on some hosts but fails on others |
| **Stale host** | Host hasn't reported a scan in over 7 days |
| **Quick win** | Easy-to-fix checks with specific remediation steps |

Each insight includes severity, affected hosts, and step-by-step remediation instructions.

### Score trends

Visualize how your security posture changes over time with score history charts on each host detail page. Spot regressions early before they become critical.

### Email & webhook alerts

Configure notifications to alert you when Clawkeeper detects issues. See [Notifications](/docs/notifications) for setup details.

### Extended history

Pro accounts retain 365 days of scan history (vs 7 days on free). Enterprise accounts have unlimited retention.
