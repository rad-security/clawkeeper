# CLI Reference

Clawkeeper is a single bash script that provides an interactive security scanner for OpenClaw deployments. Run it with no arguments to get an interactive menu, or pass a command directly.

## Interactive menu

When you run `clawkeeper.sh` with no arguments (or `clawkeeper.sh start`), you get an interactive menu:

```
What would you like to do?

  1) Scan existing OpenClaw  — audit your current installation (read-only)
  2) Deploy OpenClaw securely — full setup wizard with hardened defaults
  3) Uninstall OpenClaw      — securely remove and wipe all data

Choose [1/2/3]:
```

## Commands

### `setup`

Interactive hardening wizard. Runs all 5 phases of checks with auto-remediation prompts. This is the default experience when you choose option 2 from the menu.

```bash
clawkeeper.sh setup
```

### `deploy`

Forces a full deployment even if OpenClaw is already installed. Same checks and prompts as `setup`.

```bash
clawkeeper.sh deploy
```

### `scan`

Read-only security audit. Runs all checks but never modifies your system. Equivalent to choosing option 1 from the interactive menu.

```bash
clawkeeper.sh scan
```

### `uninstall`

Securely removes OpenClaw and wipes sensitive data (containers, images, volumes, configs).

```bash
clawkeeper.sh uninstall
```

### `agent`

Manages the Clawkeeper SaaS monitoring agent. The agent runs scheduled scans and reports results to the dashboard.

```bash
clawkeeper.sh agent --install     # Configure API key + install scheduled scans
clawkeeper.sh agent --status      # Show agent status
clawkeeper.sh agent --uninstall   # Remove agent and config
clawkeeper.sh agent run           # Run a one-off agent scan (used by scheduler)
```

### `help`

Shows usage information.

```bash
clawkeeper.sh help
```

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--non-interactive` | Don't prompt for fixes. Equivalent to `scan` mode. |
| `--report FILE` | Save a text report to the specified file path. |
| `--help`, `-h` | Show usage information and exit. |

## Deployment modes

During `setup` or `deploy`, Clawkeeper asks you to choose a deployment mode:

- **native** — runs OpenClaw directly via npm. Simpler setup, no container overhead.
- **docker** — runs OpenClaw in Docker. Better isolation, recommended for production.

## Scan phases

Every scan runs 5 phases in order:

1. **Host Hardening** — OS-level security (firewall, encryption, SSH, services)
2. **Network** — network isolation, exposed services, open ports
3. **Prerequisites** — required software (Homebrew, Node.js, Docker)
4. **OpenClaw Installation** — deployment, configuration, connectivity
5. **Security Audit** — credential exposure, CVEs, malicious skills, hardening

See [Security Checks](/docs/checks) for the full list of what's checked in each phase.

## Report output

When using `--report`, the output file contains a plain-text summary:

```
Clawkeeper Security Report
Host: my-macbook.local
Platform: macOS 15.3
Date: 2026-02-17

Phase 1: Host Hardening
  PASS  macOS Firewall
  FAIL  FileVault Disk Encryption
  ...

Score: 72%
Grade: C
```

## Exit codes

- `0` — scan completed (regardless of grade)
- `1` — error (unknown command, missing arguments)
